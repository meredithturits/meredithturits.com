    <p>When people see the pace at which I conduct my life, I doubt I
    surprise them when I explain I grew up riding subways in and out of
    New York City neighborhoods since I can remember.</p>
    <p>Although I'm probably the only writer in New York not addicted to
    coffee or...something else, I've managed to pave a career path by
    pursuing my passions for writing, photography, and this city. I'm
    currently the Assistant Online Editor at Glamour, and am actively
    freelancing for other arts, lifestyle, and New York City-based
    publications and blogs. This portfolio is a small snapshot of my
    work. If you’re interested in viewing further examples of a certain
    type of piece or particular shoot, don’t hesitate to get in
    touch.</p>
    <p>I am actively seeking additional freelance opportunities. I'm
    located in Brooklyn. Please feel free to shoot me a message with
    inquiries, comments, or to simply say hi. Please do not contact me
    at my personal email address for inquires relating to Glamour.</p>
