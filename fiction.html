      <h2>Novel synopsis:</h2>

      <p><strong>AFTER ALL IS SAID AND DONE</strong><br>
      Length: 80,000 words</p>

      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-400bd17e-dc10-5c59-c52d-fa80eca17961">In the final days of the school year in Haightford, Conn., a small, working class town outside of Stamford, a 27-year-old high school English teacher rapes a 17-year-old student in the back of a classroom. The scandal rocks the area; the teacher gets indicted on charges, but argues that he and the student had a prior relationship. It is, as expected, a mess.</strong><br>
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-400bd17e-dc10-5c59-c52d-fa80eca17961">Things are even messier for the student, TIFFANY SULLIVAN, who, along with having to deal with being sexually assaulted, becomes pregnant. She and her mother, MAURA, are keeping the pregnancy quiet, and have come to a child therapist, RACHEL STEINHAUSER, in the next town over, the very affluent Longington, so Tiffany can seek counseling on what to do about the child.</strong><br>
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-400bd17e-dc10-5c59-c52d-fa80eca17961">Rachel is just 28, and her practice has only been established for three months. Her world is fundamentally altered when she finds out that sitting in her office is the girl from the school rape case all over the news. Rachel is not equipped emotionally or professionally to deal with a situation of such magnitude. The minute Tiffany steps into Rachel's office, personal and professional life lines begin to blur, and Rachel begins to unravel.</strong><br>
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-400bd17e-dc10-5c59-c52d-fa80eca17961">She sees in the gifted Tiffany that keeping the baby would rocket the 17-year-old girl straight into adulthood—a choice Rachel herself made and is now questioning. Rachel's husband, IAN BURWELL, with whom she has been for seven years, is 39. Their marriage is contemptuous; Ian has just accepted a job with a finance firm based in London and is working European hours, their </strong><strong id="docs-internal-guid-400bd17e-dc10-5c59-c52d-fa80eca17961">relationship has gotten stale, and Rachel has begun to question whether she's living the life of a 39-year-old, not a 28-year-old. As Ian pushes her to start a family, tensions are only exacerbated.</strong><br>
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-400bd17e-dc10-5c59-c52d-fa80eca17961">As Rachel becomes more obsessed with Tiffany's case, a wedge pushes further between Rachel and Ian: Rachel's attentions are diverted, and her eyes are opened up to a life she's living, but isn't sure she wants to be.</strong><br>
      </p>
      <p dir="ltr"><strong id="docs-internal-guid-400bd17e-dc10-5c59-c52d-fa80eca17961">Through answering the questions as to whether Ian and Rachel's marriage survives, and whether Tiffany becomes a teenage mother from rape,<em>After All Is Said and Done</em>sets out to examine the way we interact with each other as life confronts us with questions we know will definitively change the courses of our lives. What do we do when we're unsure we have the knowledge—or depth of character—to address them? What happens when the identity we've built is no longer one we can trust? We have to reach beyond ourselves to find solutions—but to whom, exactly, do we turn?</strong></p>
