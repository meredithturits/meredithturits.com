      <h2>Novel synopsis:</h2>

      <p><strong>EVERYTHING I WANT YOU TO BE</strong><br>
      Length: 93,500 words</p>

      <p>In EVERYTHING I WANT YOU TO BE, 28-year-old Alexandre’s serial seduction of vulnerable girls is the only way he knows to regain control over his life, a power he feels was stripped by his twin sister Camille. Growing up in Brussels with inattentive parents, the twins developed an indelible bond—but Alex took it too far. Having rebuilt a life in Brooklyn, Alex has rewritten his past; his sister doesn’t exist, nor does his obsessive history with her. Now, there are only the city streets and the new girls. When he meets Paige, the redheaded art gallery assistant, his seduction begins as planned, but a parallel from her life to his past won’t let him trap and discard her—he may even feel what he swore he’d never let himself feel after Camille. Yet, Alex still refuses to accept that his rules are incompatible with reality. As his lies unravel and past and present threaten to converge, Alex must decide where his secrets actually belong: out in a world where honesty could allow him a future with Paige, or hidden in his fabricated version of reality.</p>
      <p><em>Everything I Want You to B</em>e is my first novel. I was previously represented from until 2012 by Foundry Literary + Media, and was on submission with interest from editors with an earlier version of this manuscript in Summer 2010. The manuscript has undergone a complete revision.</p>
