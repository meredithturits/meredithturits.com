      <h2>Novel synopsis:</h2>

      <p><strong>EVERYTHING I WANT YOU TO BE</strong><br>
      Length: 100,000 words</p>

      <p>In <em>Everything I Want You to Be</em>, main character
      CHRISTIAN’s aim is concrete: hook the vulnerable girl and spend two
      weeks crafting the flawless world she never thought she deserved.
      Then, destroy it all. 28-year-old Christian’s serial seduction is
      his only outlet to take control over his life—a power he feels was
      stripped away from him by his twin sister, CAMILLE. Growing up in
      Brussels with inattentive parents, the twins developed an indelible
      bond—but Christian took it too far, and everything he knew
      collapsed. Having rebuilt a life in Brooklyn with his own set of
      parameters, Christian has rewritten his past; his sister doesn’t
      exist, and nor does his obsessive history with her. Now, there are
      only the city streets and the new girls.</p>

      <p>Christian’s past with his sister unfolds as the novel follows him
      through his present relationship with one seductee. When he meets
      PAIGE, the redheaded art gallery assistant, everything begins on
      course, but a significant parallel from her life that strikes a
      chord in Christian won’t let him sever the tie. His formula isn’t
      working, yet he refuses to accept that his rules are incompatible
      with reality. As his lies unravel and past and present threaten to
      converge, Christian must decide where his secrets actually belong:
      out in a world where honesty could allow him a future with Paige, or
      hidden away in his fabricated version of reality.</p>
